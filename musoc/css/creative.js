The app should allow your phone to be universally controlled by another system or may be able to control another system (not necessarily another Android).  While doing this you'll have to work on various different components like key logger/screen touches, using sockets to transfer images, file transfers, live video and voice chat etc. The biggest challenge when it comes to this problem is to reduce the lag of videos over the internet. In addition to it the student will find themselves working a lot with the background services in android, which will be an amazing learning experience. ",

In the initial days the student will be involved in making basic primitives available to the user. After that the student will get to work on making simulations possible.
